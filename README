INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
    
    Mac OSX Lion
        Mac OSX does not have support natively for GNU's readline libraries.  As such things like
        perl's Term::ReadLine::Gnu will not install via CPAN or otherwise.  I got this to work by
        using Homebrew to install readline (https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/installation) and
        then linking to the readline libraries when I built the makefile in Perl.  NOTE: Homebrew
        installs core libraries and things like readline in a out-of-the-way directory so that other
        things do not break.  Here are the steps I followed:
        1) Install Homebrew.  Run the following from a terminal window/shell:
            /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/323731)"
        2) Update Homebrew
            brew update
        3) Install readline
            brew install readline
        4) Download Term::ReadLine::Gnu from CPAN and untar
        5) Make makefile, make, and install
            perl Makefile.PL --includedir=/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.2.1/include --libdir=/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.2.1/lib
            make
            make install


DOXYGEN
    Term::RouterCLI uses Doxygen for documentation.  Here are some notes for getting Doxygen working
    various platforms.
    
    The dot tool is required for dependency graphs and you can get binary builds for OSX Lion at:
    http://www.graphviz.org/
    
    Mac OSX Lion
        When you install Doxygen it will add the doxywizard application just called "Doxygen" in the
        Applications directory.  A symlink will need to be created to allow command line (terminal)
        access to the command line doxygen program.  This can be done with:
        ln -s /Applications/Doxygen.app/Contents/Resources/doxygen /usr/local/bin/
